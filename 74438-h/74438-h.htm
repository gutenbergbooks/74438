<h2 class="nobreak" id="I">I</h2>

<p class="noindent">The forces that are moving towards a
Scottish Renaissance are complex and at
first sight incompatible. The movement
began as a purely literary movement some
seven or eight years ago, but of necessity
speedily acquired political and then
religious bearings. It is now manifesting
itself in every sphere of national arts and
affairs, and is at once radical and conservative,
revolutionary and reactionary.
Engaged in traversing the accepted conceptions
of all things Scottish, it is in
keeping that it should not have set the
heather on fire. But it has made far
greater headway than what has appeared
about it in the English or Anglo-Scottish
Press would indicate. For obvious
reasons these are concerned to minimize
or ignore its manifestations. The movement
has had various more or less
short-lived organs of its own; it will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
undoubtedly acquire others. But in the
meantime it lacks any and its progress is
correspondingly obscure but none the less
real. Its inception synchronized with the
end of the War, and in retrospect it will
be seen to have had a genesis in kin with
other post-war phenomena of recrudescent
nationalism all over Europe, and to have
shared to the full in the wave of Catholic
revivalism which accompanied them. It
took the full force of the War to jolt an
adequate majority of the Scottish people
out of their old mental, moral and material
ruts; and the full force of post-war
reaction is gradually bringing them to an
effective realization of their changed
conditions.</p>

<p>At first blush there may seem little
enough connection between such phenomena
as the Clyde Rebels, the Scottish
Home Rule Movement, the “Irish
Invasion” of Scotland, and the campaign
to resuscitate Braid Scots and Gaelic.
But, adopting the Spenglerian philosophy,
the Renaissance movement regards itself
as an effort in every aspect of the national
life to supplant the elements at present
predominant by the other elements they
have suppressed, and thus reverse the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
existing order. Or, in terms of
psychology, the effort is to relieve the
inhibitions imposed by English and Anglo-Scottish
influences and to inhibit in turn
those factors of Scottish psychology which
have rendered it amenable to the post-Union
state of affairs. In closer consideration,
then, it will be seen that the four
phenomena mentioned correspond to pre-Union
conditions in Scotland. The first
takes us back beyond the demoralizing
concept of the Canny Scot, which has
conduced so largely to Scottish denationalization,
and re-establishes a psychology
in keeping with the independent traditions
of the country. The majority of the
Scottish Labour members returned to the
House of Commons went there as “internationalists.”
They were very lukewarm
Home Rulers. A short experience of
Westminster transformed them completely.
They found the vote of the
majority of the Scottish electorate systematically
vetoed by an English majority,
and saw how Scottish affairs were treated
in the House of Commons. This saltatory
emergence of a Socialist preponderance in
the Scottish representation is a post-war
product, and is interpreted from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
Renaissance point of view as a significant
reassertion of the old Scottish radicalism
and republicanism. Prior to the Union
Scotland was always “a nest of rebels”
and “never noted for loyalty to
Monarchy,” and the old Scots’ Parliament,
though far from being a democratic
body, placed on its statute book measures
of social reform in many directions in
advance of any yet enacted by the Mother
of Parliaments. An analysis of the
difference in psychology and “direction”
between the English and the Scottish
Labour and Socialist movements shows
that this interpretation is by no means
far-fetched. The English movement is
constitutional and monarchical; the
Scottish revolutionary and republican.</p>

<p>The Scottish Home Rule movement is
re-orienting itself along realist lines, and
has ceased to be mainly sentimental.
For the first time it is looking before as
well as after. It is concerning itself less
with the past and more and more with
the present and the future, and its
membership is growing in direct ratio to
its increased practicality. Most significant
of all is the fact that these developments
are marked by an ascending claim.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
It is now generally realized that no form
of devolution without fiscal autonomy
will meet the case, and that merely constitutional
means may not suffice. Bill
after Bill, backed by four out of five of the
Scottish representatives of all parties,
has been thrown out by the overwhelming
majority of English members. This is a
state of affairs which will not be tolerated
indefinitely. A premium is being put
upon militant effort; and the fact that
the Scots National League which is out
for complete independence is now growing
very much more rapidly than the moderate
Scottish Home Rule Association is
significant in this direction. At present
the nationalist Press consists of two small
monthly organs; and all the daily, and
practically all the weekly, papers are
anti-Home Rule, just as they are all anti-Socialist,
although the Scottish Socialist
vote represents a third of the electorate.
Scottish journalism is, therefore, almost
wholly untrustworthy in relation to
Scottish opinion. Realistic nationalism
and the majority elements of the Labour
movement solely, or at all events, predominantly
concerned with bread-and-butter
politics, have naturally a great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
deal in common in the existing state of
affairs, and it is not surprising that
Scottish nationalism and Scottish Socialism
should be making joint cause. Nor
is the attitude of those Liberal and Conservative
politicians who are opposing
Scottish Home Rule, or modifying their
interest in the subject, because it would
probably mean a Scottish Socialist
Government, failing to produce its own
effects. Constitutionalism that fears and
evades the will of the people signs its own
death-warrant.</p>

<p>Lord Haldane recently commented on
the stimulating and beneficial effects of
such an admixture of races as is at present
taking place in Scotland, and especially
on Clydeside. There has been a tremendous
“pother” about the “Irish
Invasion” in certain quarters. We are
told by some Protestant leaders that
Scottish nationalism is in danger. This is
a new-found zeal for nationalism, however,
obviously dictated by emptying churches.
These gentlemen represent the very factors
which have been mainly responsible for
the desuetude of Scottish nationalism.
Their anti-Irish propaganda has been of
the most unscrupulous character and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
depends for its principal effects on the
use of the terms “Irish” and “Catholic”
as synonymous. But, large as the Irish
influx has been, the recent rapid development
of which throws an adequate light
on the real motives of the protesters,
representing as they do churches which
are about to achieve Union, really a
prelude to the inevitable re-union of the
Protestant Churches and Rome, through
the indifference instead of the enthusiasm
of their remaining members and without
consultation of the Scottish people, <em>via</em> a
Parliament systematically anti-Scottish
in its policies. From the Renaissance
point of view the growth of Catholicism,
and the influx of the Irish, are alike
welcome, as undoing those accompaniments
of the Reformation which have lain
like a blight on Scottish arts and affairs.
In this connection it is useful to remember
that the Shorter Catechism, like the
concept of the Canny Scot, the myth
which has facilitated the anglicization of
Scotland, was an English invention. The
revival of Catholicism means the restoration
of the atmosphere in which Scottish
arts and letters flourished in a fashion they
have far from paralleled at any time since<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
the Reformation. I am not contending
that Protestantism is essentially antagonistic
to arts and letters. That would be
absurd. But Scottish Calvinism has
been: and just as many of the great
figures in the Irish literary movement
have been Protestants, so, on the other
hand, if there is to be cultural progress in
Scotland, must many of the emerging
artists be Catholics.</p>

<p>As to Scots, here, again, its desuetude
was largely due to the Reformation and
to the Union with England. Its “direction”
is completely at variance with the
“direction” of English; and the present
state of English literature on the one hand,
and the newer tendencies in Europe to
which London is most antipathetic on the
other, considered in conjunction with the
special virtues of Scots, suggests that the
psychological moment for its revival has
arrived and that through it lies a way for
the successful re-entry of distinctively
Scottish culture into the European stream.
The Burns influence has been wholly bad,
producing little save puerile and platitudinous
doggerel. It is necessary to go
back behind Burns to Dunbar and the
Old Makars—great Catholic poets using<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
the Vernacular, not for the pedestrian
things to which it has latterly been confined,
but for all “the brave translunary
things of great art.” The younger
Scottish poets are repossessing themselves
of noble media and high traditions; and
a splendid mystical and imaginative spirit
is reuniting them over a period of five
centuries with their mighty predecessors.
Even the Burns cult itself, which long
confined itself to an “annual guzzle” on
the poet’s birthday, is now proclaiming
itself a Scottish literary and patriotic
organization, and advocating the teaching
of Scots in the schools. And the Scottish
Education Department is reported to be
favourably disposed. Can the headway
that has been made during the past few
years be more impressively illustrated?</p>

<p>The Scottish Renaissance Movement is
even more concerned with the revival of
Gaelic than of Scots. It regards Scotland
as a diversity-in-unity to be stimulated
at every point, and, theoretically at any
rate, it is prepared to develop along trilingual
lines. Actually the revival of the
Gaelic—and the output of Gaelic letters
of quality, despite the efforts of the Hon.
Ruaraidh Erskine of Marr, is lagging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
behind in comparison with Braid Scots,
and it is questionable whether Gaelic has
any similar alignment with the “becoming
tendencies” in <i lang="de">Welt-literatur</i>. Or it
may be that the present position calls in
the first place for recognition, and modern
applications, of the Pictish rather than
the Gaelic elements in Scottish culture.
On the other hand, proposals for the
establishment of a great Gaelic College
have been taken up enthusiastically by
the Clans Association in America, and are
already well advanced. Far-reaching
developments are imminent in this
direction. Here again, materialism is
giving way to new spiritual ideals, and in
Gaelic we return closer then ever to the
old Scotland.</p>

<p>All these movements then represent
so many antitheses of the tendencies
which have dominated Scotland since the
Union and have conjointly driven it so
far along the road to Anglicization. They
are asserting themselves and have arrested
the tendency to assimilate Scotland to
English standards just when it seemed on
the point of complete success. Lost
ground is being rapidly recovered; efforts
are being made once more to create<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
distinctively Scottish literature comparable
in artistic quality and tendencious
force to the contemporary output of other
European countries, and to regain the
independent cultural position of Scotland
in Europe; efforts are being made to
create a Scottish national drama and
Scottish national music—both of which
Scotland alone of European countries
entirely lacks, mainly because of Calvinistic
repression—and all these efforts are
achieving a measure of success. Scottish
genius is being liberated from its Genevan
prison-house. But the centralization of
British arts and affairs in London is still
restricting it in ways that can only be
redressed by that re-orientation of facilities
which would follow the re-establishment
of an independent Scottish Parliament,
or, in the event of a return to the
system of Provinces, a federation of
assemblies. The movement cannot manifest
its full stature and move freely, save
within that framework of a Scotland
become once again a nation in every sense
of the term for which it has been designed.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="II">II</h2>

<p class="noindent">In the foregoing chapter I have given an
account of the movement upon which it
seems to me the future of Scotland
depends—or, rather, a Scottish future of
Scotland. Scotland, of course, may have
another future. It may become a Roman-Catholic
country with a predominantly
Irish population. Or its progressive
anglicization and provincialization may
continue until it becomes to all intents
and purposes a part of its English neighbour.
The latter is still the likeliest;
the former has only within the past few
years emerged as a serious competitor.
But the main point to seize upon in the
meantime is that, apart from the
“Scottish Renaissance Group,” the rest
of the Scottish people in Scotland to-day
are not Scottish in any real sense of the
term. They have no consciousness of
difference except in detail; “distinctions
without difference.” They are all the less
Scottish in proportion to their ardour as
Burns enthusiasts, members of St
Andrew’s and Caledonian Societies and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
the like. Just as the majority of Socialists
become conscious of the economic
causes of their plight but retain (often
in an exacerbated form) the types of ideas
on other matters which spring from the
same source, so the vast majority of Scots
to-day—even Scottish Home Rulers—regard
as typically Scottish the very
sentiments and attitudes which are the
products of their progressive anglicization.
Scotland is suffering from a very
widespread inferiority complex—the
result of the psychological violence
suffered as a consequence of John Knox’s
anti-national policy in imposing an
English Bible (and, as a consequence,
English as the basis of education) upon
it, and of the means by which the Union
of the Parliaments was encompassed and
by which its inherent intention of completely
assimilating Scotland to England
has since been pursued. Weaker minds
find compensation in a “romantic
nationalism”—sedulously dissociated
from politics and practical realities of
every kind. The others accept the situation
and transcend it; that accounts for
such phenomena as Scottish Prime
Ministers, Archbishops of Canterbury and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
York, “heids of departments” of all
kinds, the ubiquitous Scotsman generally,
most of the Scottish aristocracy, and such
writers of English as R. L. Stevenson,
R. B. Cunninghame Graham and Norman
Douglas. But these—or some of them—are
only exceptions that prove the rule
that the Anglo-Scottish symbiosis leads
to nullity. There is a third class who are
“more English than the English”—who
become panicky immediately any question
arises as to the benefit to Scotland of
its present relationship to England, who
regard everything “Scottish” as beneath
contempt, and, in short, manifest all the
symptoms of a “specific aboulia” in the
presence of any challenge to their submerged
nationalism. They have been
un-Scotched and made “damned mischievous
Englishmen.” The “nationalism”
of the first of these three classes is such
that it has been unable to create any
literature, music or drama of more than a
local value. It is hopelessly provincialized.
The history of Scottish Vernacular
poetry, for example, since the days of the
Auld Makars, is a history of the progressive
relinquishment of magnificent potentialities
for the creation of a literature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
which might well have rivalled the
English. The only challenge to the
decline was that of Allan Ramsay and
Ferguson—which Burns, in the last
analysis, betrayed. The influence of
Burns has reduced the whole field of
Scots letters to a “kailyaird.” So with
music. Scottish mediæval music was
ahead of English. To-day, Scotland is
the only country in Western Europe which
has failed to develop an art-music,
though it has as available basis perhaps
the finest inheritance of folk-song in the
world. Scarcely any effort is being made
even yet to create a national school of
composers in Scotland, although the
creation of such national schools in every
other country in Europe—at their third
and fourth stage of development now in
most of them—has constituted during
the past half century or so one of
the greatest revolutions in music. So
far as Scottish music is concerned it
remains at best practically where it
was in the sixteenth century. Music in
Scotland is another matter. An effort is
presently being made to found a Scottish
Academy of Music in conjunction with a
Chair of Music in Glasgow University.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
But the title is a misnomer. It will be
merely an Academy of Music in Scotland—probably
under a Welshman. In his
new book, <cite>Music: Classical, Romantic,
and Modern</cite>, Dr Eaglefield Hull deals very
succinctly with the position of Scottish
music to-day. “Scotland,” he says, “the
country with the loveliest scenery, the
most thrilling history, a rich inheritance
of literature, and hundreds of the finest
love-songs in the world, has no national
school of musical composition. Mac. after
Mac. goes down into England and loses
his musical soul for a mess of pottage!
It is useless to ask whether Scotland
stands where she did in music, for apart
from folk-music she has no standing at all.
It is indeed high time that she set to work
to put her house in order. In Donald
Tovey, David Stephen, Francis George
Scott, Erik Chisholm, and others, there
is fine material which must be utilized.
But the cultivation of a School of Scottish
composers can only be carried on within
its own borders.” But he goes on to
throw out a suggestion of no little significance.
“Perhaps,” he says, “Scotland
is waiting for some awakener from outside
to make her thrill to a sense of her great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
mission, such as John Field in Russia,
Glinka in Spain, and Jean Aubry in
England. The spark is undoubtedly
there, and only needs fanning.”</p>

<p>Association of ideas leads me to think
how the distinctively Scottish genius has
manifested itself in alien fields, however
inhibited it may have been at home. My
main purpose here is not to discuss the lets
and hindrances which have prevented the
development of modern arts in Scotland,
nor will my space permit me to analyse
the complexities of Scottish character and
circumstances responsible for our comparative
failure to find expression on the
higher levels of culture. But it is curious
to find that in relation to the cultures of
other countries, or in association with
foreign elements in the constitution of the
individuals concerned, Scotsmen, or half-Scotsmen
have, with a surprising consistency,
continued to manifest elements
distinctively Scottish which clearly relate
them to the Auld Makars, to the ballad
makers, to our mediæval Scots musicians,
and to that elusive but unmistakable
thread of continuity which attaches the
work of Norman Douglas, for example, to
that of Sir Thomas Urquhart, the translator<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
of Rabelais. Wergeland, the
Norwegian poet, was conscious of the
idiosyncratic power of the Scottish blood
in his veins. So was a greater poet—the
Russian Lermontov. So was Hermann
Melville; so—to take a living example—is
Walter de la Mare, whose <i lang="fr">diablerie</i>, the
finest element in his work, is probably
attributable to his Scottish blood, as, in
his case, were some of Browning’s amusing
tortuosities and prepossession with
dialectical excesses. This Scottish strain
is tremendously idiosyncratic, full of a
wild humour which blends the actual and
the apocalyptic in an incalculable fashion.
In his able analysis of the complexities of
the Scottish genius Professor Gregory
Smith has called it “the Caledonian
antisyzygy”—a baffling zig-zag of contradictions—and
he traces it down the
centuries in a most interesting fashion,
remarking that “There is more in this
Scottish antithesis of the real and fantastic
than is to be explained by the familiar
rules of rhetoric. This mingling, even of
the most eccentric kind, is an indication
to us that the Scot, in that mediæval
fashion which takes all things as granted,
is at his ease in both ‘rooms of life,’ and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
turns to fun, and even profanity, with no
misgivings. For Scottish literature is
<ins class="corr" id="tn-23" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'more medieval in'">
more mediæval in</ins> habit than criticism has
suspected, and owes some part of its
picturesque strength to this freedom in
passing from one mood to another. It
takes some people more time than they
can spare to see the absolute propriety
of a gargoyle’s grinning at the elbow of a
kneeling saint.” And Professor Gregory
Smith goes on to express the opinion that
this incalculable Scottish spirit will continue
to survive in English arts and letters
pretty much as a dancing mouse may
manifest itself in a family of orthodox
rodents—as something disparate, an
ornament, or an excrescence, but irreconciliable
to any major tradition and
incapable of affording a basis for any
higher synthesis of the Scottish genius.</p>

<p>That may be; on the other hand, its
expansion may await a conjunction of
conditions which have not yet arisen.
It has affiliations to the baroque and the
rococo, and evidences are not lacking
of a widespread renewal of interest in
these modes. But a more important
fact is that this complicated wildness of
imagination is, in Scots literature,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
associated with a peerless directness of
utterance</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

reaction against the Renaissance.
Observe the huge extent to which dialect
is entering into the stuff of modern literature
in every country. Dialect is the
language of the common people; in
literature it denotes an almost overweening
attempt to express the here-and-now.
That, in its principle, is anti-Renaissance.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
Basil de Sélincourt<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and
many others observe that modern English
shows signs of fatigue in comparison with
Chaucer’s. Chaucer was a poet with this
power of plain speech. He never flinched
from the life that was being lived at the
moment before his eyes. A farmyard,
with its straw, its dung, its cocks and
hens is not, some people have thought, a
poetic subject; Chaucer knew better.
Dunbar with the aid of Scots achieved
effects beyond Chaucer’s compass with
an utterance even more simple and
straightforward. It has been said that
Dunbar had for his highest quality a
certain unique intensity of feeling, the
power of expressing that passionate and
peculiar force which distinguishes and
differentiates us people of the North from
our Southern neighbours. What is this
unique intensity of feeling, this power of
direct utterance, but the pre-Renaissance
qualities of which I am writing? Braid
Scots is a great untapped repository of
the pre-Renaissance or anti-Renaissance
potentialities which English has progressively
forgone.</p>

<p>But it goes far deeper than language,
this “Caledonian antisyzygy,” and music
in the long run may utilize it more fully
and finely than literature. It is here that
I join issue again with my essential theme—to
find what I have said concerning the
persistence of this queer Scots strain
extraordinarily exemplified in modern
music in the work of Erik Satie. Satie’s
middle name was Leslie; his mother
was a Scotswoman. Satie was a “musical
joker.” His most distinctive and important
work was a species of fantastic
experimental clowning, hardening later
into satire. His work and his methods
should have the special consideration of
every Scottish artist—every musician in
particular—who is puzzled as to how he
may profitably exploit the peculiarities of
Scottish psychology of which he is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
conscious. Paul Landormy calls him “a
freakish musician, more inventor than
creator, the composer of ‘Pieces in the
Form of a Pear,’ of the ‘Bureaucratic
Sonata,’ and other fantastic products of
a whimsical yet quite elegantly witty
imagination,” but—and this is the vital
thing—he admits that “he furnished
certain elements of that new language
which the composer of <cite>Pelleas</cite> used for
loftier ends.” This is no little understatement
of Satie’s significance. Dr
Eaglefield Hull says: “This kind of
musical irony is the most individual
and personal of all types of art. The
composer writes for a few detached
individual people, who would scoff at
the rest of humanity. Only very
‘superior’ people can appreciate such
irony, which passes from an elegant wit to
a brutal sarcasm.” But he goes on to
say: “Historically Satie was of immense
importance. The music on Satie’s twelve
pages (of his first work, <cite>Sarabandes</cite>, 1887)
is even a greater landmark than either
Debussy’s or Chabrier’s work. The
‘diaphony’ of his sevenths and ninths
was to become part and parcel of the
harmonic decoration of Debussy and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
Impressionists.... He was the father of
atonality in music. Side by side with all
his strangeness and boldness are passages
of the most amazing commonplaces,
which are difficult to explain except as
satirical allusions.” Exactly! What is
this but the “Caledonian Antisyzygy”
precisely as Professor Gregory Smith
describes it, but manifesting itself in
modern music to ultimately triumphant
effect. There is no need, then, for Dr
Hull to say “His father was French and
his mother Scottish. We wonder to
which source his outstanding characteristic
of humour is due.” Surely it is
along similar lines in Scotland itself that
our difficult national characteristics may
yet be turned to musical account and
make the basis of a new technique, at
once completely modern yet intimately
related to the whole history of Scots
psychology and conjoining in the closest
fashion the artists we are about to
become, if the Scottish Renaissance
realizes its objectives, with the Auld
Makars and the ballad makers whose
achievements we have yet to parallel
and continue.</p>

<p>As with literature and music so with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
drama and dancing this tale might be
continued. The explanations of Scotland’s
leeway lie in the Reformation, the
Union with England and the Industrial
Revolution. If I isolate the second of
these as the main cause, it is because it
was indispensable to the consummation
and continuance of the first and largely
determined the effect upon Scotland of
the third. There are people who imagine
that but for the Union with England
Scotland would still be destitute of all
the blessings of modern civilization. They
find no difficulty in associating this belief
with the idea that Scotsmen are thrifty,
hardworking, exceptionally well-educated,
law-abiding and home-loving. I am not
one of them. I believe that the Industrial
Revolution would have spread to Scotland
much less injuriously if England had
suddenly disappeared about 1700. I
believe that the concept of the “canny
Scot” is the myth (as M. Delaisi puts it)
which has made Scotland governable by
England and has prevented the development
since the Union of any realistic
nationalism worth speaking about. True,
it has been so insidiously and incessantly
imposed that the great majority of Scots<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
have long been unable for all practical
purposes to do other than believe it themselves.
Yet there are notable exceptions;
the traditions of Highland soldiering, for
example—the “ladies from Hell.” Even
the “canniest” Scot does not repudiate
these as un-Scottish. At all events the
effect of all these three causes was overwhelmingly
repressive and anti-Scottish.
The Reformation, which strangled
Scottish arts and letters, subverted the
whole national psychology and made the
dominant characteristics of the nation
those which had previously been churl
elements. The comparative cultural
sterility of the latter is undeniable. A
premium was put upon Philistinism.
There has been no religious poetry—no
expression of “divine philosophy”—in
Scotland since the Reformation. As a
consequence Scotland to-day is singularly
destitute of æsthetic consciousness. The
line of hope lies partially in re-Catholicization,
partially in the exhaustion of
Protestantism. The Union with England
confirmed and secured the effects of the
Reformation. It intensified the anglicization
that the introduction of an English
Bible and the <cite>Shorter Catechism</cite> (with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
which England itself so promptly dispensed)
had initiated. It progressively
severed the Scottish people from their
past. The extent to which this has gone
is almost incredible—especially if taken
in conjunction with the general attribution
of an uncommon love-of-country to the
Scots. English has practically vanquished
Scots (which is not a dialect but a sister
language to English, with different but
not inferior, and, in some ways, complementary,
potentialities) and Gaelic.
There is very little Scottish Education in
Scotland to-day. The type of international
education which is everywhere
gaining ground to-day is that which seeks
to perfect, and even to intensify, different
cultures already existent among different
peoples, and sets for its ideal that each
people has, first, the right to its own
interpretation of life; and, second, the
duty of understanding, and sympathizing
with, the different interpretations given
by its neighbours as fully as possible.
Back of this type of international education
lies the belief that differentiation in
matters of culture is more valuable to life
than a stereotyped homogeneity. This,
so far as Scotland is concerned, is the aim<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
and object of the Scottish Renaissance
movement; and it is high time that
the Scottish Educational System was
attempting to change-over to this type of
education rather than adhering partly to
the imperialistic and partly to the eclectic
types, both of which, as Professor
Zimmern says, “belong rather to the past
than to the present,” except, alas, in
Scotland, which once prided itself on
leading the world in matters of education.
A recent Committee of Enquiry, set up by
the Glasgow branch of the Educational
Institute of Scotland, reports that no
school-book dealing with Scottish history
is of a satisfactory character. This,
although a remarkable advance in professional
admission, is a sheer understatement.
Scottish history is only now
in the process of being rediscovered and,
once the labours of the new school of
Scottish historical researchers come to be
synthetized, it will be found that even
such comparatively “Scottish” Scottish
Histories as Hume Brown’s have to be
thrown overboard, as little more than a
mass of English propaganda. It is only
within recent years that any attempt has
been made to teach even such “Scottish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
history” in Scottish schools, and then
subsidiarily to English, and, as it were,
as a make-weight or after-thought—to
the older children. Scots literature is in
even worse case, although here, too, there
has been a slight improvement during the
past decade. The increasing—if still
insignificant—Scoticization of Scottish
Education during recent years is, of
course, not a product of the propaganda
of the Scottish Renaissance Group. To
what is it attributable? How can it be
accounted for if the policy of England
and, even more determinedly, of Anglo-Scotland,
let alone the over-riding
tendency of modern industrialism, is
towards the complete assimilation of
Scotland to England? In my opinion
it is a product partly of the latent criticism
of the industrial order and partly of a
realization of the cultural exhaustion of
English (<em>vide</em> “<cite>Pomona</cite>”)—an instinctive
protective re-assembling of the forces
suppressed by the existing order of things
which has made for the predominancy of
English. This explanation accords with
the doctrine Spengler expounds in his
<cite>Downfall of the Western World</cite>. “The
Caledonian Antisyzygy,” instead of being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
a disparate thing destined to play a
baroque, ornamental, or disfiguring rôle—<i lang="fr">chacun
à son goût</i>—in English literature
may be awaiting the exhaustion of the
whole civilization of which the latter is
a typical product in order to achieve its
effective synthesis in a succeeding and
very different civilization. In the history
of civilization therefore the sudden suppression
of Scots, with all its unique
expressive qualities may prove to have
been a providential postponement; it
may have been driven underground to
emerge more triumphantly later. Its
coming musicians and writers must
address themselves to it, as Mussorgsky,
following Dargomisky’s dictum that “the
sound must express the word,” addressed
himself to Russian—with Mallarmé’s
“adoration for the property of words”;
just as they must recollect that the “pure
poetry” of some of the contemporary
Continental expressionists was anticipated
and carried far further long ago in their
<cite lang="gd">Canntaireachd</cite>, or mnemonic notation of
the MacCrimmons—a basis upon which
they may profitably build. To detail
the arguments in support of this “theory
of Scots letters” would take up more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
space than I can afford; but I must
interpolate a brief outline of them here,
for they bear in one way and another on
all the issues with which I am concerned.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="III">III</h2>

<p class="noindent">Not Burns—Dunbar! That is the
phrase which sums up the significant
tendency which is belatedly manifesting
itself in Scots poetry to-day. At first
it may seem absurd to try to recover at
this time of day the literary potentialities
of a language which has long ago disintegrated
into dialects. These dialects
even at their richest afford only a very
restricted literary medium, capable of
little more than kailyard usages, but quite
incapable of addressing the full range of
literary purpose. They are the <i lang="la">disjecta
membra</i> of a language; the question is,
whether they can be re-integrated and
re-vitalized. Can these dry bones live?
Like feats have at all events been accomplished
elsewhere—in regard to Provençal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
in France, Catalan in Spain, the Landsmaal
in Norway, and so on. Those who
would try it in Scots must first of all
recover for themselves the full canon of
Scots used by the Auld Makars and
readapt it to the full requirements of
modern self-expression. This is no easy
task. Why should it be attempted?
One answer is because English is incapable
of affording means of expression for certain
of the chief elements of Scottish
psychology—just as English has no
equivalents for many of the most
distinctive words in the Scots vocabulary.
Another answer is that there is a tendency
in world-literature to-day which is driving
writers of all countries back to obsolete
vocabularies and local variants and
specialized usages of language of all kinds.
This is not the place to more than indicate
considerations such as these. Suffice it to
say that a little group of Scottish writers
to-day are alive to them and conscious
of an overwhelming impulse to return
more deeply “into the pit whence we
were digged” than any Scot has felt
impelled to go for several centuries.
Burns, although he used a certain amount
of synthetic Scots of his own, not sticking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
to any one dialect and recovering words
that had ceased to be used, did not know
the works of his great fifteenth-century
predecessors well enough to make anything
like full use of the linguistic material
available. This is what makes Carlyle
say that if Burns had been “a first-class
intellectual workman he might have
changed the whole course of literature.”
That opportunity still remains open,
however, for anyone who can revive the
potentialities of the Scots language manifested
in Dunbar and since then almost
wholly forgone in favour of the very
different potentialities of English.</p>

<p>The effect of Burns’ work on Scots
poetry is well-known. It has reduced
it to a level that is beneath contempt.
Little or no poetry that has been produced
in Scots since Burns’ day has been of a
quality to support comparison for a
moment with the average of contemporary
poetry in any other European country.
It is all of the kailyard kind; sentimental,
moralizing, flatfooted, and with little or
no relation to reality. I have suggested
in the preface to my selection of Burns’
work in Benn’s <cite>Augustan Poets</cite> that
critical revaluation of Burns is overdue—or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
has, perhaps, been tacitly accomplished—except
by Burnsians and anthologists.
Perhaps poetry-lovers have carried the
winnowing process too far. Reacting
from hackneyed favourites, and immune
from the Burns cult, they have not
troubled to go over his work again—still
less considered it from the standpoint of
what is best by Scottish, if not by English,
standards. Much of the best, and least
known, of Burns depends for appreciation
on a thorough knowledge of Scots. This
is its “growing end.” His poetry in
English is wholly negligible, and of his
work as a whole it may be said that it
rises in poetic value the further away
from English it is, and the stronger the
infusion of Scots he employs.</p>

<p>But it is not a question of language
only but of content. A great deal of
Burns’ work is eighteenth-century conventionalism
of a deplorable kind. Most
of his love-songs have a deadly sameness.
The task of Scottish poetry to-day is to
rise out of the rut in which it has so long
been confined. It is here that the return
to Dunbar is of the utmost value. It
means that Scots poetry may be rescued
at last from the atmosphere of hopeless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
anachronism which has long kept it so
“fushionless.” It has been said that if
Burns is the heart, Dunbar is the head, of
Scottish poetry: and certainly at any
time during the past century Scots literature
has had desperate need to pray
Meredith’s prayer for “More brains, O
Lord, more brains.” Dunbar is in many
ways the most modern, as he is the most
varied, of Scottish poets, whereas all but
a fraction of Burns’ work (and that
fraction by no means confined to the most
generally known portion of it) is irrevocably
dated and almost indistinguishable
from the ruck of imitations of it to which
Scots poets have so largely confined themselves
during the subsequent century and
a half. Even Professor Gregory Smith
admits that “there cannot be any quarrel
about the richness of the Scottish vocabulary,
its frequent superiority to English
in both the spiritual and technical matters
of poetic diction, its musical movement
and suggestion, and, generally, what have
been called the ‘grand accommodations’
in the craft of writing as well.” Intelligent
young Scots a few years ago might
very well have been excused for failing
to detect any of these great qualities in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
the very inferior types of Scots literature
they came into contact with. Scottish
children are only taught a little Burns
and a few of the ballads. They are not
taught anything of the Auld Makars.
For the most part their attention is confined
to English literature. It is not
surprising, therefore, that they should
regard Scottish literature as a mere side-line,
and that, in consequence, Scottish
literature should lose the greater part of
those who should be contributing to it
rather than to a foreign literature, which,
in any case, prefers its own sons and
daughters. But with the re-discovery
of Dunbar in particular by young Scottish
poets during the past few years new
possibilities have opened up. They
realize now upon what grounds testimony
is borne to the richness and resource of
the Scots language. In Dunbar they see
them displayed in a way far beyond anything
accomplished since. They see Scots
allied to noble ideas, high imaginings,
“divine philosophy,” and no longer confined
to the foothills of Parnassus, and
when they resurvey the problem of the
revival of Scots from that angle, many of
the difficulties of readjusting and utilizing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
it to serious literary purpose which have
hitherto proved baffling are dispelled.
Most of the people who are trying to
revive the Doric are, at the same time,
trying to maintain its “pawkiness,” its
“canniness,” its kailyardism and so
forth—in a word, they are trying to revive
Scots and yet remain within the stream
of tendency responsible for its progressive
decay. It would be truer to say that it
is Braid Scots—not Scots—with which
they are concerned. Their method is
that of exact dialectical demarcation—they
do not believe in mixing dialects—they
contemplate no synthesis. What
alienates the young creative writers,
conscious of the inadequacy of their
purpose alike of English and of what has
still any currency as Scots, from the
Vernacular Circle people is precisely that
the latter have anything but a literary
purpose. Not one of them is capable or
desirous of envisaging the creative potentialities
of Scots or sufficiently involved
in questions of literary technique and
tendency to appreciate that so far as the
literary outcome of what they are professing
to attempt goes it must depend,
not only on intuitions in profound harmony<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
with the phonetic and expressive
genius of Scots, but also in effective
relation with some major tendency in
European literary evolution. If there is
to be further writing in Scots these people
want it to be as like what has gone before
it from Burns’ time as possible: otherwise
they will be the first to condemn it as
un-Scottish. But they are not caring
much about further writing in Scots at
all; they want to maintain the Burns
cult and the cult of such lesser lights as
Tannahill, and “<cite>Johnny Gibb o’ Gushetneuk</cite>.”
Any Scottish aspirant worth a
bawbee is bound to recognize that this
is hopeless. The Vernacular Circle is a
“vicious circle.” No revival of Scots
can be of consequence to a literary aspirant
worthy of his salt unless it is so aligned
with contemporary tendencies in European
thought and expression that it has
with it the possibility of eventually
carrying Scots work once more into the
mainstream of European literature. The
re-discovery of Dunbar can solve the
difficulty for every would-be Scots writer
who stands divided between his reluctance
to go over bag and baggage to English
literature and his inability to rise above<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
the Kailyaird level through the medium
of Kailyaird Scots. Dunbar stands at
the opposite pole of the Scottish genius
from Burns. The latter has ruled the
roost far longer than it is healthy for any
literature to be dominated by a single
influence. It is time, and more than time,
for a swing of the pendulum which, if it
carries us back over the centuries to
Dunbar, may also regain for Scots literature
some measure, at all events, of the
future that was foregone at Flodden.</p>

<p>It is the possibility and increasing
probability of such a swing of the pendulum
that Mr G. M. Thomson seems to me
to have disregarded in his cogent, but far
too pessimistic, essay on <cite>Caledonia: or
the Future of the Scots</cite> in this series. But
I am at one with him in regard to the
desperate state of Scottish arts and
affairs to-day and in the absence of such
developments as I indicate and their
timely expression in an effective form, my
anticipations could not materially differ
from his. His melancholy outlook is due
to his failure to recognize that the
Scottish Home Rule Association, the
Scots National League, the Scottish
National Movement, the Scottish National<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
Convention, the Scotland’s Day Committee,
the Scottish Renaissance Group
and other bodies fully realize the position
he describes, and have been making
marked headway during the past two or
three years. Mr Thomson’s reference to
the Porpoise Press (which has done
excellent work) does not excuse his failure
to give credit to <cite>The Scottish Chapbook</cite>,
<cite>The Scottish Nation</cite>, <cite>The Northern Review</cite>,
<cite>The Scots Independent</cite>, <cite>Scottish Home Rule</cite>,
<cite lang="gd">Guth na Bliadna</cite>, and other organs which,
severally and jointly, have been of far
greater consequence in this redevelopment
of cultural and political nationalism.
Nor—otherwise accurate as is his account
of Scotland’s industrial plight—can he
be excused for failing to realize the
significance of the electrification policy.
Scotland would never have been selected
for this purpose if it had been so destitute
of an industrial future as surface appearances
suggest. The North of England
is suffering in many respects just as
Scotland is doing, but Mr Thomson should
have realized the import of the map on the
cover of <cite>The Northern Review</cite>, which
showed not only Scotland but England as
far down as Hull and Liverpool. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
country between the Humber-Mersey line
and the Forth and Clyde line corresponds
to the old Brythonic kingdom. This is our
real centre of gravity. Most of our heavy
industries are centred there—most of
our mineral wealth—and statistics show
that an overwhelming percentage of
Scottish and English genius alike of all
kinds has come from that area. Politics
have led to an extraordinary distortion;
but there can be little doubt that economic
realities will yet redress the balance as
between London, on the one hand, and
that area on the other, and in effect
endorse the Southward policy of the old
Scots Kings. In any case there is still an
ample Scottish population in Scotland
to redevelop the essential nationalism—if
they can be aroused to a recognition of
the necessity of it and, with the support
of the international tendencies to which I
have referred (which in turn they would
strengthen), avert the calamity he indicates.
The calamity, however, is
imminent; and all but a moiety of the
people are unconscious of its imminence
or indifferent. The conscious minority
has, perhaps still a decade in which to
develop a “Scottish Idea” complementary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
to Dostoevsky’s “Russian Idea”
(Dostoevsky’s mistake was to imagine
that Russia alone could prevent the
robotization of Europe) and in so doing to
demonstrate that Professor Denis Saurat
divined aright the larger hope of the
Scottish Renaissance Movement when he
wrote that in achieving its immediate
objectives it might do more—it might
save Europe. It is significant that
Spengler, and Laurie Magnus in his
<cite>Dictionary of European Literature</cite>, both
look to “one of the smaller countries”
with a similar hope. But, as Saurat
says, to “burn what we have hitherto
adored” is the pre-requisite of such a
Scottish Renaissance.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV">IV</h2>

<p class="noindent">With increasing frequency there is a
paragraph in the Scottish papers—more
particularly the local papers, not the
“national” organs—telling how a debate
on the question of Home Rule for Scotland
has been held here or there, and, almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
invariably, the paragraph ends with the
statement that, on a vote being taken,
there was a large majority in favour of it.
That is to say a majority of that small
minority who attend meetings. No one
who is in the habit of going up and down
the country and coming into varied contact
with the public can fail to observe
that more and more are inclined to the
movement with a sympathy which has
greatly intensified within the past few
years. These are they, in my opinion,
who “feel in their bones” the larger
issues of which I have been speaking, but
have not yet developed more than a
political reaction to them. Observers
of very different shades of political opinion
agree that the time is ripening for a new
political nationalism, as part and parcel
of a general national awakening. There
is little agreement, however, as to how
this widespread latent feeling may be
crystallized, in the best interests of
Scotland and the wider interests
inevitably involved. Partial views, and
partial solutions, abound; but none of
these proffered precipitants are powerful
enough to act on more than a small
proportion of the flux of opinion that is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
obviously awaiting effective re-direction.
What is it that intervenes in ninety-nine
cases out of a hundred, to prevent the
sympathetic Scotsman from giving any
practical effect to his feelings on such a
matter?</p>

<p>Scotland is unique among European
nations in its failure to develop a nationalist
sentiment strong enough to be a vital
factor in its affairs—a failure inconsistent
alike with our traditional love of country
and reputation for practicality. The
reason probably lies in the fact that no
comprehensive-enough agency has
emerged; and the commonsense of our
people has rejected one-sided expedients
incapable of addressing the organic complexity
of our national life. For it must
be recognized that the absence of Scottish
nationalism is, paradoxically enough, a
form of Scottish self-determination. If
that self-determination, which, in the
opinion of many of us, has reduced
Scottish arts and affairs to a lamentable
pass, is to be induced to take a different
form and express itself in a diametrically
opposite direction to that which it has
taken for the past two hundred and
twenty years, the persuading programme<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
must embody considerations of superior
power to those which have so long
ensured the opposite process. Scottish
opinion is anachronism-proof in matters
of this kind. The tendency inherent in
the Union, to assimilate Scotland to
England, and ultimately to provincialize
the former—the stage which has been so
unexpectedly but unmistakably arrested
at the eleventh hour—has, as a matter
of fact, not yet been effectively countered
by the emergence of any principle
demanding a reversed tendency. That is
why, despite the persistence in Scotland
of an entirely different psychology, the
desire to retain and develop distinctive
traditions in arts and affairs, and the
fairly general recognition that the
political, economic and social consequences
of the Union have never been by
any means wholly favourable to Scottish
interests and have latterly, in many ways,
become decreasingly so to a very alarming
degree, there has nevertheless been at
most little more than a passive resistance
to complete assimilation masked by an
external acquiescence. This is because
Home Rule has been conceived for the
most part, even by its advocates, merely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
as a measure of devolution—a continuance
of substantially the same thing as
prevails at Westminster; not something
fundamentally different and answering
to the unexpressed needs of the Scottish
spirit. It is this passive resistance which
accounts, for example, for the comparative
paucity and poverty of distinctively
Scottish literature since the Union. Only
that fringe of the Scottish genius amenable
to Anglicization has continued to find
expression; the rest has, practically,
“held its tongue,” and, to a large extent,
its powers of expression have atrophied.
A similar phenomenon manifests itself in
our schools. Many teachers tell me that
the children’s abilities to express themselves,
and, behind that, to think, are
largely suppressed by official insistence
upon the use of “correct English.” They
actually think, and could express themselves
a great deal more readily and
effectively, in dialect. This tenacity of
Scots in the life of our people is extraordinary.
Observe the way even
“educated people” lapse into it on convenient
occasions, or when they are
genuinely moved. To ban it from our
schools is, therefore, a psychological<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
outrage. A distinctive speech cannot
be so retained in the intimate social life,
in the thinking of a people without an
accompanying subterranean continuance
of all manner of distinctive mental states
and potentialities. The inhibition of
these is all the worse when, as in Scotland
to-day, they are denied their natural
pabulum—when, for example, as so
often happens, an appeal to Scottish
sentiment is applauded by those who,
owing to the way in which our educational
system has been organized, have
little or no knowledge of our separate
history and culture, and have been taught
to take it for granted that Scotland’s
future is wholly identified with England’s,
and that economic and social expediency
are best served by discarding the shibboleths
of “a distinction without a difference.”
It is upon these camouflaged or
hidden forces, however—many of them
unconscious—that the ultimate direction,
if it has any, of “Scotland—a Nation,”
must depend. Only so can Scotland, as
such, re-enter the mainstream of European
arts and affairs. This reservoir of
“difference” has not yet been tapped by
any of our Scottish nationalist movements;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
few, indeed, have realized its existence
or made it their objective. That is why
they have been so ineffective. But
latterly there has been a significant
change. Its promise lies in the fact that
it is not limited to Scotland, but, as Dr
J. M. Bulloch has said, is a world-movement,
naturally becoming specially
well-defined in Scotland, to “set up a
resistance to the efforts, many of them
due to mechanisms and not a few to
political theories, to make us all of one
mind.” It is manifesting itself in many
diverse ways—not yet co-ordinated into
a comprehensive reversal of the general
tendency it is arresting.</p>

<p>The recent Scottish breaks-away from
English domination in regard to such
widely-separated interests as the lifeboat
service and the protection of birds are
straws which show the way the wind is
blowing. Cultural forces have manifested
themselves and demonstrated the timeliness,
if not the necessity, of specifically
Scottish developments in relation to the
European situation as a whole. Religious
forces are now manifesting themselves.
The “Irish invasion” may be the “point
of departure.” Happily it is already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
clear that we have here far more, and far
other, than (as Dr G. F. Barbour puts it)
“the ominous beginnings of a form of
controversy from which Scotland has long
been free—that regarding religious education.”
Art and religion—if these two are
being nationalistically stirred, we have
the conditions we have hitherto lacked for
the re-creation of a dynamic Scottish
nationalism. These are factors of
incalculably greater power than those
which have already produced the meagre
and ineffective phenomena of Scottish
nationalism since the Union—and factors
leading right back into that “reservoir
of indifference” of which I have spoken.
It <ins class="corr" id="tn-53" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'is not suprising'">
is not surprising</ins> to find, with the
emergence of significant developments in
these two great fields of consciousness,
a simultaneous leap in the membership
of the political nationalist societies. That
membership has more than trebled itself
within two years. And the measure of
autonomy which is being contended for
has increased proportionately. So long as
Scottish Home Rule was regarded as,
more or less, an end in itself, it was
incapable of attracting a sufficient
measure of active support to demonstrate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
the falsity of calling it—as most of the
papers persist in calling it—“the absurd
demand of a handful of fanatics.”</p>

<p>There is a time-factor in all these things.
The discoveries which have recently
revolutionized physical science are due
to a strain of “heresy” in mathematics,
long ridiculed and sterile, but now come
to its own as the medium of stupendous
discoveries the heretics themselves never
anticipated in their wildest dreams. The
position in regard to Scottish Nationalism
to-day is not dissimilar. A form of
Scottish Home Rule would probably
ultimately have been granted, if for no
other reason than the congestion of
business at Westminster—a matter of
mere administrative convenience; and
the present attempt to destroy the last
vestiges of Scottish control of Scottish
affairs by the wholesale transference of
Departments to London is probably due
to the realization that this goal, which
was almost within grasp, is unaccountably
receding. It would have made for greater
efficiency, and, temporarily, for economy—but
it would not have been utilizable
for the deeper purposes I have indicated.
On the contrary it would have represented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
the last step in the assimilation of Scotland
to England. Scottish Home Rule
Societies in the past have sought little
more; and have encountered, in Scotland,
the overwhelming objection to a “glorified
County Council.” The deep intuitions
of the people were right. The time had
not come. All the bills hitherto promoted
to give Scotland this or that measure of
self-government have been inadequate
means to the ends in reserve. Has the
time come now? Unlike any of its
predecessors the latest Draft Bill is
“nation-size” and in significant alignment,
if only in the steepening of its
demands, with those profounder stirrings
of the national consciousness to which
“mere politics” are comparatively
irrelevant, although in the last analysis
they may be dependent upon them, as
the big things in life often are upon the
little.</p>

<p>The Bill as an end in itself would still
be of little consequence perhaps; but as
a means to steadily emerging ends which
cannot yet be clearly defined, but which
it is obviously anticipating and likely to
facilitate, it is on a different plane. And
its promoters cannot realize too clearly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
that, as Charles Maurras has said, “The
man of action is but a workman whose
art consists in taking advantage of the
lucky chances. All politics come back
to this art of lying in wait for the <i lang="it">combinazione</i>,
the happy chance. A moment
always comes when the problem of
success is a question of insight, and
reduces itself to a search for what our
Ancients called <i lang="la">junctura rerum</i>, the place
where the bony structure bends, though
it is rigid elsewhere, the place where the
spring of the action will play.” Success
may be unexpectedly near, and stupendous
in its sequelæ.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">
<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="V">V</h2>

<p class="noindent">In the meantime the extirpation of “a
Scottish accent” in the Scottish schools
continues almost unabated, although, as
Lady Margaret Sackville says, and as the
cultural poverty of post-Union Scotland
amply attests, “language imposed
mechanically upon a people without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
understanding of their peculiar ways of
thought can only be stultifying; and it
is an impertinence to substitute a pert,
half-baked, and complacent education
for the very ancient culture which the
Vernacular represents. Let education
rather work hand in hand with this
culture and humbly learn from it to its
own great gain.” But the general
attitude to England, and Scotland’s
relation to it, is far deeper, and for the
most part other than mere “protective
mimicry.” Apart from the claim to
which I have referred there is a widespread
reluctance to think about the matter—to
discuss it in any way. No probable,
perhaps no possible, development of Scots
Nationalism could lead to a complete
disjunction of the two countries; or
preclude their remaining parts of the
British Empire. Opponents of Scottish
Home Rule, of course, generally argue
that such a measure would be a piece of
retrogressive parochialism at variance
with the part we are called upon to play
as citizens of a great Empire. Especially
is this argument being used against the
newer forms which that demand is taking.
The reason for this is that they represent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
that growth or rebirth of national sentiment
in Scotland in recent years, which
has brought with it the increasing realization
that any measure of devolution which
does not carry with it full financial
autonomy is not worth having. Besides,
the powers granted to the Irish Free State
render it impossible, as derogatory to its
historical status as a nation, that Scotland
should accept any less. The latest Draft
Bill meets these considerations, and is
thus a far more advanced measure than
any of its eleven predecessors. A typical
comment runs as follows: “The Old
‘Home Rulers,’ while they aimed at
autonomy for the management of the
strictly domestic business of Scotland,
jealously safeguarded Scotland’s position
in the United Kingdom and the Empire.
Nothing was more repugnant to them
than the idea that the country should
cease to have its full representation in the
Imperial Parliament. In the new Bill
that ceases, and Scotland in nearly everything
but a joint interest in the armed
forces becomes detached and isolated;
and provision appears to be made for
the severance at some future time of
even this link.... It is a reversal of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
the whole process of constitutional progress
which governs British history.”
This is the generally accepted view. But—apart
from the fact that Great Britain
occupies an altogether disproportionately
important place in the Empire which the
growth of the other elements must drastically
correct in time—it is, nevertheless,
completely at variance with the history
and present prospects of our constitutional
evolution. So far from being a reversal
of the process of constitutional progress
which governs British history, it is a
fresh and salutary manifestation of it, and
constitutional experts are increasingly
realizing and proclaiming that it is only
by a general extension and speeding-up
of this process that the Empire can be
maintained and prevented from sharing
the fate of all the other great centralized
Empires of the past. “Empire,” as a
matter of fact, is now a misnomer; the
term ought rather to be the “British
Association of Free Peoples.” Upon the
development of the utmost freedom of
each and the inter-relations with each
other of the various elements in this
great diversity-in-unity the future of the
“Empire” depends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>This point of view is admirably
expressed by Viscount Dunedin, who
says: “The secret of the tie that unites
the Empire—the rock on which it is
built—is the autonomy of local law. And
not merely local law, but autonomy of
local law making—in other words—legislation.”
And he pointed out that the
Privy Council had been more solicitous
of the principle of legislative autonomy
than the Dominions themselves. The
Scottish Home Rule demand is, therefore,
strictly in accord with the very life-spirit
of the Empire, and it is the attempt to
assimilate Scottish law and legislation
to English and to secure uniformity,
instead of permitting the free development
of inherent diversity in accordance with
distinctive national genius that is anti-Imperial.</p>

<p>The opponents of the new Draft Bill
cannot have it both ways. The same
type of people have objected to all the
previous bills on the ground that these
would only result in transforming Scotland
into a “glorified County Council.” It is
the realization of the truth of this that
has prompted the greater demand
embodied in the present Bill. Without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
the power of the purse a Scottish Parliament
would, indeed, have been a mere
glorified County Council, and such a
measure would have completed, instead
of reversing, the shameful provincialization
of our country.</p>

<p>The Empire not only stands in no
danger from Scotland coming into line
with the other component parts of it, but
it will give Scotland for the first time an
effective say and share in Imperial affairs.
Scotland has contributed far too much to
the upbuilding of the Empire to want to
withdraw from it. It is, indeed, the very
opposite motive that is at work. It is
the recognition of how grossly anomalous
it is that Scotland, which has contributed
so preponderantly to Imperial development,
should be relegated to so inferior
and ineffective a place in it, and have no
voice in determining and disposing its
future. Scotland has been placed at an
intolerable disadvantage in this connection
compared with almost every other
part of the Empire, and the newer
developments of autonomy in the
Dominions are relegating Scotland to a
more and more subordinate rôle, entirely
out of keeping with its due as one of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
great founder nations of the Empire.
The new Bill is designed to rectify matters
and accord to Scotland its due place in
the economy of the Empire. Under it,
Scotland will re-acquire a real part in
relation to Imperial and world-affairs.
At present it has no effective part in
either. The constitution of the House of
Commons is such that the Scottish vote
is subject to the perpetual veto of the
English majority, although English
political psychology is profoundly different
from Scottish and the economic conditions
and requirements of Scotland profoundly
different from those of England. Scotland,
to-day, has no effective representation
anywhere—on the Imperial Conference,
on the League of Nations, on
Inter-Parliamentary Delegations and on
any of the other great international
bodies which are playing rôles of
cumulative importance in world-affairs:
but, given a distinctive place again, there
is every reason to hope that this old
historical nation, which once occupied
so notable a place in Europe, and which
has been one of the main sources
of our Imperial power, may again
play a part proportionate to its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
past and in keeping with its particular
genius.</p>

<p>What is commonly forgotten, too, in
matters of this kind, is that Scotland itself
is part of the Empire. A concern with
Scottish domestic welfare is just as much
an Imperial consideration as preoccupation
with the affairs of any other part of
the Empire. The welfare of the Empire
depends upon the welfare of each of its
component parts. Scotsmen may help
the Empire best by keeping the heart of it—the
source of much that is best in it—sound
at home. Surely it cannot be
contended that Imperial policy demands
the dereliction of Scotland? Will it not
serve the Empire best in the future, as it
has done in the past, if Scotland can once
again become the home of a vigorous and
multiplying people from which the
Colonies overseas can continue to draw
robust settlers? The idea that Scottish
Home Rule is at variance with Imperial
tendencies and requirements is, in fact,
an erroneous and short-sighted one, while
the contrary opinion is supported by the
recollection of the great part Scotland has
played in Imperial affairs in the past—and
cannot, assuredly, continue to play if its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
population is to be decimated, its
industries ruined, and its countryside
depopulated and thrown out of cultivation.
Yet the latter is the effect of the
neglect of Scottish affairs which is the
settled—and natural—policy of the
overwhelmingly English House of
Commons. It represents a greater
menace to the Empire than any Separatist
movement can ever become because it
strikes at the very heart of Imperial
strength. The present policy of
encouraging emigration in regard to
Scotland is nothing more or less than a
killing by our overseas dominions of the
goose which has hitherto laid many of
the best clutches of their golden eggs.</p>

<p>Let me add here that Scotland is not
only the most neglected country in
Europe to-day, but the most highly
taxed. A vehicular and passenger bridge
across the Forth is refused to Scotland
by Englishmen, but Scots must contribute
towards the £7,000,000 or £8,000,000
granted for a bridge across the Thames.
Scotland’s housing is a disgrace to
Western civilization, although Scots
builders are such efficient workmen that
they are welcomed in England and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
overseas. Scotland has the highest
death-rate, the highest sickness-rate, and
the highest infant mortality rate in the
British Isles, although naturally it is no
less healthy than England, Ireland or
Wales. Scotland contains 2,000,000
acres of land which are certified as suitable
for cultivation and small holdings,
although during the last ten years her
agricultural population decreased by
15,000. There are fewer small holdings
in Scotland now than in 1911, when the
Small Landholders Act was passed by the
London Parliament. Like facts can be
adduced in regard to every other aspect
of Scottish affairs. They are the inevitable
counterparts of her cultural declinature.
Verily “Without the Vision
the people perish.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VI">VI</h2>

<p class="noindent">Several reviewers of the Rt. Hon.
H. A. L. Fisher’s biography of the late
Viscount Bryce have expressed their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
surprise that Bryce had not at least some
measure of practical success with his first
legislative love, the Bill to give free access
to Scottish mountains and moors. As
one of them well remarked, “Forty years
ago there was no more popular measure.
The mention of it on a public platform
never failed to jog a lackadaisical audience
into enthusiasm. How thankful many a
Liberal orator felt that he could wind up
by declaring his ‘whole-hearted concurrence
in principle and in part with that
measure sponsored by the Member for
South Aberdeen, which would give the
people of Scotland freedom to enjoy their
health-giving heritage.’ It was a
measure easy to advocate and difficult
to oppose, even in the days before the
motor car had driven the pedestrian
from the by-ways as well as the highways.
But to this day not one practical step in
its realization has been taken; there is
still no legal access to Scottish mountains
and moors.”</p>

<p>It is, indeed, one of the most curious
of all puzzles in political psychology. Of
the reality of the need for it, and of the
abundance of public support, there is no
question. Why, then, is nothing done?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
Whoever can answer that question can
explain the whole position of Scotland
to-day. It is not enough that a measure
should be clamantly called for by the
needs of the Scottish situation; it is
not enough that the mere mention of it
should be sufficient to jog the most
apathetic body of Scottish electors into
enthusiasm; it is not enough that it
should have the support of the overwhelming
majority of the Scottish M.P.s
of all parties. All these three considerations
can be fulfilled, and have been
fulfilled, in respect to Scottish Home
Rule and other questions, and yet not
only is nothing at all done, but the proposed
solution never even emerges into
what is known as “the sphere of practical
politics.” Why is this?</p>

<p>But, whatever the reason, it is
obviously not to the credit of the Scots
M.P.s and their constituents that such
measures should have to be supinely
forgone; the realities of the Scottish
national position treated as unrealities
while the catch-vote tactics of professional
politics are permitted to monopolize
public and Parliamentary attention; and
the whole principle of democracy in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
regard to Scottish affairs stultified in this
obscure but overwhelming fashion. Somehow
or other the situation must be
changed, so that measures corresponding
to the actual requirements of our nation
can be carried into the field of practical
politics—and not allowed to “fail to
carry” in this way. The whole impression
of Scottish politics is like that of a
man dominated by a sort of a nightmare
he cannot shake off. He would fain get
back to his true self—but he cannot
move. Just as reading certain papers
one gets a wholly disproportionate and
unfortunate conception of the world as a
place where murders, divorces and all
sorts of sensations and scandals are
dominant—so the present political
system entirely distorts and misrepresents
the real condition of Scottish affairs
and bogs the attention of the electors in
all manner of “professional political”
issues which have little or no bearing on
their interests, while the latter are
excluded from the “sphere of practical
politics.” What is wanted is a movement
to shake off all the old shibboleths, the
tyranny of the catch-phrases; and to
found a new conception of politics on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
basis of a practical concentration upon
the actualities of our national situation.</p>

<p>The Scottish Protestant Churches have
manifested increasing alarm for several
years over what has become known as
the “Irish Invasion” of Scotland. There
is no dispute as to the facts. The Irish
population is rapidly increasing; the
native Scottish population is rapidly
declining. The former is mainly confined
to the big industrial centres; the latter
is leaving the cities, but to a still greater
extent is leaving the countryside. The
position is that, owing to Irish, and other
alien immigration, our urban congestion
is not being relieved by the continual
drain of emigration. All that is happening
is that a certain proportion of Scottish
people is being replaced there annually
by an equivalent of un-Scottish people.
While this is happening in the towns,
which, despite all the emigration, continue
to show 50 per cent. more unemployment
than in England, our rural areas are being
steadily depopulated of their irreplaceable
native peasantry—and nobody is taking
their place. The seriousness of the matter
on either count cannot be exaggerated.
But the vital thing is not the influx of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
Irish and other aliens, but the exodus of
Scots. It is due to our present economic
system—to the condition of Scottish
industries on the one hand which renders
them incapable of paying adequate wages
to Scottish employees and ready, therefore,
to supplant them with cheaper Irish
labour, and, on the other hand, to the
lack of a progressive and native agricultural
policy. The causes are political
and economic, and if the consequences
have religious and social bearings, these
should not lead to any misconception as
to the causes and any confusion as to
how these can, and should be, dealt
with. Sectarian trouble, for example,
over a purely economic question, is not
likely to help matters. This is the danger
some of the Scottish Protestant Ministers
are running. Their failure to penetrate
to the real causes is blinding them to the
only solution. That solution is a re-orientation
of Scottish affairs on such a
basis that Scottish industries and interests
would not be systematically sacrificed
to English, but developed in accordance
with the particular requirements of Scotland,
as they could be developed if
Scotland were not compelled to pay, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
it is under the present system, upwards
of £120,000,000 per annum to the Imperial
Exchequer, out of which it receives back
only some £30,000,000. If the Scottish
contribution were equitably applied, many
millions a year would become available
for Scottish commercial and industrial
developments, and not only could the
flow of Scottish emigration overseas be
arrested, but a stream back to Scotland
would speedily set in if Scotland could
offer its exiled people anything like the
conditions they are obtaining in the
colonies. They did not want to emigrate.
Economic conditions forced them. Only
economic conditions can bring them back.
This will never happen so long as a system
is applied which is willing to spend £2,000
in settling a Scots overseas, but unwilling
to spend £1,000 to settle him at home—although
the percentage of such home
settlements as have been effected (a
miserably small percentage of the applications)
which has been successful has been
much greater than amongst overseas
settlements, relatively expensive as the
latter are. Most important of all is the
necessity for devising and financing a
thorough-going agricultural policy for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
Scotland, designed to do for it, in accordance
with its specific requirements, something
like what Denmark and other small
nations have achieved for themselves by
co-operative methods. But what hope is
there for the initiation of any such policy
under the present system? Scottish
Independence is an indispensable preliminary
to any attempt to solve Scottish
problems in such a fashion as may arrest
the deplorable efflux of Scottish people
and the progressive dereliction of the
Scottish soil.</p>

<p>Dealing with the question of Irish
Immigration, the Committee on Church
and Nation of the Established Church of
Scotland says: “There are only two
explanations of the great racial problem
that has arisen in Scotland—the emigration
of the Scots and the immigration of
the Irish people. There does not seem to
be any hope of alleviation of this problem
in the future. All available evidence
points to its intensification. The outlook
for the Scottish race is exceedingly grave.
If ever there was a call to the Church of
Scotland to stand fast for what men
rightly contend dearest—their nationality
and their traditions—that call is surely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
sounding now, when our race and our
culture are faced with a peril which,
though silent and unostentatious, is the
gravest with which the Scottish people
has ever been confronted.”</p>

<p>This is true—but not exactly in the
sense the Committee intends. It will
not do to identify Scottish nationality
and traditions wholly with Protestantism.
There has always been a considerable
native Catholic population, and most of
the finest elements in our traditions, in
our literature, in our national history,
come down from the days when Scotland
was wholly Catholic. Neither, in speaking
of a “silent and unostentatious peril”
will it do to overlook the fact that
Scotland has been steadily subject to
Anglicization ever since the Union. This,
since it does not raise the “religious
bogey” in the way the Irish immigration
does, is apt to be overlooked, but it should
have at least as much attention as the
other from the “Scottish” Churches, if
at last they are seriously concerned with
Scottish nationalism, and not merely
with a sectarian issue. Until they face
the whole issue of Scottish Nationalism
and define what they mean by it and by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
national culture, they will be suspected
of merely using the term to cover an
interest in special issues by no means
synonymous with it, however importantly
they may be related to it. But the part
is not greater than the whole, and an all-round
statesman-like attitude is what is
necessary, and should be forthcoming
from a Church that is truly Scottish and
has the deepest interests of Scotland at
heart. Nor will these ministerial protagonists
gain anything by suggesting
that “Scottish employers of labour ought
to do their utmost to retain their fellow-countrymen
at home.” The suggestion
takes no cognizance of economic realities.
Nor is the suggested restriction of
immigration any more feasible under the
existing system. It is impossible to
discriminate against the Irish in that way
as long as we are co-members of the
British Empire. If anything is to be
done it must be along the lines of re-acquiring
Scottish control of Scottish
affairs, and more particularly such a
measure of financial autonomy as would
enable projects like the mid-Scotland ship
canal, land settlement on a far greater
scale, the creation of co-operative agencies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
in our agriculture, afforestation and so
forth, to be developed in a way the
House of Commons has not allowed—in
short, to undo the present neglect of, and
contempt for, Scottish affairs, and their
treatment, where they have had any,
within the limits of alien and inappropriate
conceptions, which are largely
responsible for the pass to which we have
been brought, and which cannot be
undone until we have once again a
Parliament of our own and are free to
move on the axis of our own mentality.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VII">VII</h2>

<p class="noindent">“We should be the last to assert that
there are no aspects of the smaller
nationalism worth conserving,” says
another opponent; “there are many,
but the best of them are alive and effective
in Scotland to-day, and they have no
necessary connection with the structure
of Government. But Scotland, without
losing her sense of herself as a Scottish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
nationality, has attained to a full and
complete sense of a larger nationality,
and she is not going to throw off that
sense of partnership in larger nationality
under the leadership of archaic and
thrown-back minds, all of them belonging
to the largely denationalized region of
Clydeside.” Now the fact of the matter
is that no valuable aspect of “the smaller
nationalism” is permitted to function,
except under extraordinary handicaps,
by the conditions of progressive Anglicization
(in violation of even such safeguarding
clauses as the Treaty of Union contained),
which have increasingly dominated
Scotland during the past hundred years.
Scotland has ceased to hold any distinctive
place in the political or cultural map
of Europe. The centralization of book-publishing
and journalism in London—the
London monopoly of the means of
publicity—has reduced Scottish arts and
letters to shadows of their former or
potential selves, qualitatively beneath
contempt in comparison with the distinctive
arts and letters of any other country
in Europe. There is no Scottish writer
to-day of the slightest international
standing. Scotland connotes to the world<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
“religious” bigotry, a genius for materialism,
“thrift,” and, on the social and
cultural side, Harry Lauderism and an
exaggerated sentimental nationalism,
which is obviously a form of compensation
for the lack of a realistic nationalism. No
race of men protest their love of country
so perfervidly as the Scots—no country
in its actual conditions justifies any such
protestations less. Every recent reference
book in any department of human
activity shows the position to which
Scotland has degenerated. “Europa,
1926” (although it is presumably
designed for British readers) lists contemporary
Czech and Bulgarian poets,
litterateurs, musicians, etc. (the bare
names—which convey nothing!) but it
excludes Scotland completely. Ireland,
on the contrary, has a section to itself,
and a special article on the boundary
question. Professor Pittard’s “Race and
History,” doing justice to every other
people under the sun, deals only very
slightly and imperfectly with Scotland,
and fails to take account of any of the
newer material, <em>e.g.</em>, the works of Tocher.
Like examples can be multiplied in every
direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>Again, letters from Paris, or “Our Irish
Letter,” etc., are familiar features of
English newspapers. Whoever saw a
“Scottish Letter”? Concern with
Scottish interests of any kind has been so
completely excluded from publicity, has
been made so completely a case of
“beating the air,” that the usual headlines
following a “Scottish Night” at
Westminster are “Absent Members—Empty
Benches—During Discussion on
Scottish Estimates,” while from the
report it appears that the debate resolves
itself into a potpourri of stale jokes.
Scotland alone of all European countries
that have ever been in anything like its
position relatively to any other country,
has failed to develop a Nationalist Movement
capable of affecting the practical
political situation in some measure or
other. Why have the Scottish members
of all parties who have supported the
numerous successive Scottish Home Rule
measures acquiesced so tamely in their
defeat at the hands of the English
majority? There must be more in this
acquiescence than meets the eye. It
represents an abrogation of themselves,
for all effective purposes, as the political<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
leaders of Scotland of which it is inconceivable
that they should be guilty, unless—behind
the ostensible position—they
were cognizant of a power against which
they were incapable of contending, a
power so possessed of the monopoly of
mass publicity that it could completely
stultify them by its all-pervasive
<i lang="la">suppressio veri, suggestio falsi</i> the instant
they went beyond a given line.</p>

<p>Contrasting the pre-Union achievements
and promise of Scottish arts and
letters with the beggarly results since, it is
not too much to assert that Scottish
Nationality was sold for “a mess of
pottage,” and that Scotland has since been
paying the price by submitting to the
diversion of her entire energies into purely
materialistic channels—not, however, as
the present condition of Scotland and
Scottish industries shows, for its own
benefit. For whose, then? That I shall
attempt to indicate. But, first of all, it
cannot be too strongly stressed that
its social, commercial, and industrial
conditions to-day afford strong <i lang="la">prima
facie</i> evidence that if, as is commonly
contended, Scotland has owed a great deal
materialistically (whatever it may have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
lost in other directions) to its Union
with England, it has now wholly ceased to
derive any such advantages; the boot,
indeed, is on the other foot; and on that,
as on other grounds, it is high time to
reconsider the relationships between the
two countries.</p>

<p>What prevents the development of
well-informed and positive policies in
regard to such problems as that of the
Scottish Highlands? Col. John Buchan,
M.P., expressed the opinion in a letter
to the present writer that “it is impossible
to make up one’s mind on the Scottish
Home Rule question—the necessary facts,
and figures are not available.” Why are
they not available? In certain directions
these have been systematically refused by
Government Departments—or purposely
embodied along with the English in such
a way that comparisons between the two
countries cannot be instituted. In other
directions the refusal of financial facilitation,
as Mr William Graham, M.P., has
pointed out, has resulted in the creation
of a tremendous leeway in the economic
and social documentation of Scotland, so
that in practically every direction
laborious independent research is necessary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
to get at the facts and figures. They
are nowhere readily available.</p>

<p>The vested interests of the Scottish
daily papers are all part and parcel of the
sequelæ of the Union. They all “make
a show” of Scottishness by dealing in
windy and suitably contradictory generalizations
with Scottish topics—but they
all toe the secret line. Letters sent in by
readers are carefully censored. Opinions
may be expressed (preferably anti-nationalist,
or, better still, merely sentimentally
nationalist), but facts and figures
are not permitted—or, at all events, only
isolated ones. Nothing can get published
that attempts to relate facts and figures
in regard to Scottish subjects to each
other, and thus, to a national policy of any
kind. There is not a single paper that
dare publish a series of articles dealing
thoroughly and systematically either with
the case for Scottish Home Rule or with
any of the major social or economic
problems of Scotland. Nor dare they
relax their vigilance in respect of the
utterance of Scottish M.P.s in Parliament.
Only so much is allowed “through”;
the rest must be kept back in the sieve.
What does appear must appear so fragmentarily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
and disjointedly—and be so
offset by the facetiousness and belittlement
of leaders and tittle-tattle paragraphs—that
it cannot conduce to the
creation of any “well-informed and
positive policy.” What hidden interests
behind the newspapers dictate this
corruption of their natural functions and
insist upon a journalism to bamboozle
rather than educate the public—a journalism
to make “confusion worse confounded”
rather than to clarify national
issues in a systematic and rational
fashion? What is the meaning of the
whole position and policy that is, superficially,
so determinedly unintelligible?</p>

<p>It is utterly irrational to find all the
real practical issues of a nation “outwith
the sphere of practical politics” and that
sphere monopolized by professional-politician
issues, few of which have the
most indirect bearing upon national
realities. It is utterly irrational to find a
whole electorate bemused and misled (for
all practical purposes) by such an abracadabra.
That is the position of Scotland
to-day. All the Scottish papers aver that
the demand for Scottish nationalism is
made by “a handful of fanatics,” and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
has no real weight of “public opinion”
behind it—but what is “public opinion,”
and how far is it reflected by a Press
which, in a country which has always
been overwhelmingly radical and republican,
and where to-day a third of the
entire electorate vote Socialist, is solidly
sycophantic and anti-socialist? <cite>The
Glasgow Herald</cite>, in a recent leader,
observed that there was no need for
street-corner oratory in these days of a
great free Press whose columns are open
for the expression of all manner of
opinion, and its editor, Sir Robert Bruce,
is frequently to be heard dilating on the
high status and professional integrity of
the journalist to-day. Yet it is simple
fact that there is no free Press and that
journalists hold their jobs by opportunism
and cannot afford to “own their own
souls.” A man with “ideas of his own”
is of no use in a modern newspaper office.
The vigilance of the Press censorship—the
ubiquitous range and insidiousness
of the policy behind it—is such that even
<cite>The Glasgow Herald</cite> does not, and cannot,
permit signed correspondence on such
subjects as Scottish music or drama, for
example (let alone politics), if these go<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
against the ideas of the vested interests
concerned with these departments, not to
speak of the veiled interests behind these
vested interests which “hold all the
strings in their hands.” Interplay of
opinion is confined to opposing views
within a certain range; but the essence
of the matter all the time, so far as the
ultimate interests are concerned, is
“Heads I win, tails you lose.” It is
this that makes a goblin of the vaunted
Scottish hard-headedness and practicality—induces
the amazing supineness of the
successful protagonists of Scottish Devolution
Measures when these are rejected by
the English majority at Westminster—prevents
any real Scottish issue emerging
into the realm of “practical politics”—makes
the systematic neglect of Scottish
interests of all kinds a subject for stereotyped
jokes in the Scottish Press (professedly
favourable to “legitimate”
nationalist aspirations—in China)—prevents
different sections of the Scottish
public realizing that their diverse grievances
and difficulties spring from a
common centre and denies them those
publicist services which would effectively
relate consequence to cause—and foists,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
not least upon Scotsmen themselves, that
stock conception of the “canny Scot,”
which is so belied by the actualities of our
national position that it can only be
accounted for by saying that if, as M.
Delaisi argues, government is impossible
unless a myth of some kind is foisted
upon the “people,” then, so far as Scotland
is concerned, its present disastrous
condition is due to the fact that the
existing myth is out of touch with
realities to a degree so abnormal that
history presents no parallel to it.</p>

<p>Discussing the possibilities of a Scottish
Renaissance I have written elsewhere
that the Credit Reform proposals of Major
C. H. Douglas will be “discerned in retrospect
as having been one of the great
contributions of re-oriented Scottish
genius to world-affairs,” and that I wished
to record my unqualified pride and joy in
the fact that of all people in the world a
Scotsman—one of the race that has been
(and remains) most hag-ridden by commercial
Calvinism, with its hideous doctrine
of ‘the need to work,’ ‘the necessity
of drudgery,’ and its devices of ‘thrift,’
and the whole tortuous paraphernalia of
modern capitalism—should have absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
‘got to the bottom of economics,’
and shown the way to the Workless
State.</p>

<p>It is significant that practically the
only, and certainly the only real (if,
unfortunately, only very partial and
temporary) political triumph Scotland has
scored over England since the Union of
the Parliaments took place just over 100
years ago: and was associated with the
name of a great Scotsman and with
precisely the type of business which it
has since become almost physically
impossible to think—let alone speak—about.
The Banking System! I refer
to Sir Walter Scott’s <cite>Letters of Malachi
Malagrowther</cite>. Just how much Scott
(albeit a Tory of Tories, and a national
liability rather than an asset in most
respects), was roused by the Government’s
proposal that Scottish Banks should cease
to issue notes “in order to unify paper
currency throughout the United Kingdom,”
can be gauged from his veiled
threat that “claymores have edges.”
Scott’s agitation was so far successful
that the Government dropped their
proposals inasmuch as they related to the
Scotch pound notes—for the time being.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
“Very probably,” says a recent writer,
“they realized that there was real
determination behind Scott’s reference to
claymores—even if it did not actually
mean the wielding of these lethal weapons
to enforce the protest.” All who are in
earnest about Scottish Home Rule should
take a note of that. Evidences of “real
determination” must be forthcoming if
anything is to be achieved. The Parliamentary
record of the Scottish Home
Rule question would long ago have driven
protagonists of any mental and moral
calibre to the realization that an irresistible
premium had been put upon the
recourse to militant methods, and that
anything else is a waste of time—“an
expenditure of spirit in a waste of shame.”</p>

<p>But a great deal has happened since
1826. The existence of a Scotsman of
Sir Walter’s calibre was a nasty snag for
the Government of the day—but the
policy behind them could afford to wait,
to pretend to yield; it is not every
generation, happily, that throws up such
a figure to thwart its purposes, although
Lord Rosebery <em>did</em> concede that Scotland
is “the milch cow of the Empire.” There
has appeared no Scotsman since of equal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
size to do anything analogous and to
expose the tremendous losses to Scotland
through the financial unification of
Scotland with England that has since
been consummated. The dangers that
Scott apprehended and warded off a
hundred years ago are fully battening on
Scottish interests to-day, and they are
powerless to defend themselves. How
powerless is indicated by the fact that
the Scottish Press (whose columns are
shut to all discussion of national realities)
gives prominence to such ridiculous statements
as that of Mr Ridge Beedle,
prospective Unionist candidate for the
Camlachie Division of Glasgow, who says
that “it is owing to the Scottish Home
Rule Movement that new industries are
not settling in Scotland; industrialists
are preferring locations in England where
continuity and settled conditions are
assured.” Thousands upon thousands of
Scottish electors are so hopelessly bemused
that they swallow an absurdity like that
as if it were a self-evident truth. If it
were, the difficulties of Scottish Nationalism
would be over. Our English competitors
would be falling over each other
to subsidize it and ensure its success.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VIII">VIII</h2>

<p class="noindent">Here the connection between the diverse
movements in Scotland I indicated as so
superficially incompatible becomes clear.
The Credit Reform Movement is essentially
one for the removal of all the false
restraints under which humanity is labouring.
It is not without significance that
its leader, Major Douglas, should belong
to the race which has suffered most
abominably from the forms under which
it has been subjected to two of the greatest
agencies—the Reformation and the
Industrial Revolution—which the impelling
force, which has multiplied these
restrains until “civilization” is tending
to reduce the majority of mankind to the
condition of robots, has utilized in securing
that stranglehold on life which it is
now visibly exercising. Will Scotland
yet produce</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Eighth marvel of seven on earth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A Douglas at peace?”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Do not the intolerable conditions to which
it has been reduced, the unparalleled
anomalies in its “national” finance,
suggest that a flanking movement against
the Powers of Finance may be best
achieved through it. This is “the place
where the spring of action will play”—where
alone a counterforce to that which
is not only making for centralization in
all directions and superannuating such
agencies of differentiation as Scots and
Gaelic, but would eliminate religion by
completely mechanizing the masses of
mankind and make Socialism the last
and worst stage in capitalism—the Servile
State—rather than the first in a new and
nobler order, can be generated. Here is
the “comprehensive-enough agency”—“the
nation-size principle”—the meeting
ground of Scottish Nationalists, Catholics
and Socialists, those diverse elements
upon whose recognition of their interdependence,
their need to complement and
moderate each other, depends not only
the realizable proportion of the ideals of
each but a Scottish Renaissance of international
consequence. Let us not fight
with enemies—England, commercial
Calvinism, “Progress,” thought-hating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
democracy—which are merely the agents
of the foe that is really worthy of our
steel, the cause that lies behind them all;
but, in concentrating on the latter, remember
that every other nation has suffered
in like fashion to some degree from its
operations, and make common cause with
the elements in all these other countries
which are seeking to overcome it.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that banking and
national interests in Scotland are far
more conspicuously divorced from each
other than in most countries. There is
less “cover” here than at the centre.
Leading Scottish bankers do not discourse,
like their English brethren, on current
topics; they confine themselves to the
business in hand. Mr McKenna and the
like may create a diversion by pretending
to let, not the cat, but one or two of its
meows out of the bag occasionally, but
in Scotland the public is too docile even
to need “circuses.”</p>

<p>The amalgamation of the Scottish
banks with the English, along with such
subsidiary developments or sequelæ of
the same policy, as the amalgamation of
the railways, and the English control of
Scottish newspapers, represents one side<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
of that picture of which the inevitable
obverse is the fact that the collective area
of deer forests (1,709,892 acres in 1883)
is now 3,599,744 acres; seventeen Scottish
counties to-day have a population less
than it was fifty years ago, eleven have
less than in 1821, and five less than in
1801; and of the remaining population
of the country more than 45 per cent.
(over two million people) live more than
two in a room!</p>

<p>These tendencies are continuing at an
accelerating rate. This is the price
Scotland is paying for its “sense of participation
in a larger nationality”—a sense
that even then must be qualified by
recognition of the fact that the “larger
nationality” will in turn be subjected
to the same “policy” as the “smaller”
(although both, no doubt, may continue
a while longer to have a sense of “Empire”)—unless
Scotland comes to the rescue of
England in the manner suggested.</p>

<p>The Scottish Convention of Burghs (of
which I have been a member) is the
oldest municipal institution in Europe—it
is also the most effete and powerless.
Otherwise its continued existence would
not be tolerated for a moment. Let it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
discuss with any “real determination”
the effect of the amalgamation of the
Scottish banks, railways, etc., with the
English—or the relation of the banking
system to the policy of neglect and deliberate
“misunderstanding” which is
eviscerating Scotland—and it will
speedily see the end of its long history.</p>

<p>Scotland’s, and more than Scotland’s,
only hope—albeit yet a slender one—is
through the Scottish Socialist movement,
and, it may be, one of its Irish Catholic
leaders. The closer inter-relationship of
the Scottish Socialist and Nationalist
Movements, their increasing identity of
personnel, and happily, their tardy concentration
on the financial aspect, is the
one promising feature in the situation,
unparalleled in history, in which a whole
nation, reputedly hard-headed and
patriotic, have been almost ineradicably
persuaded by (mainly alien—or alienated)
financial interests that black is white and
white black until they wax only the more
perfervid in their patriotic protestations,
and the more diligent in their Sisyphus
task of futile “thrift,” the more their
country is denuded of population, status,
and prosperity, and themselves of all that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
makes life worth living. It is significant
that <cite>The Scotsman</cite> and other Anglo-Scottish
papers dealing with the new
Draft Bill, are increasingly conceding the
“advantages” of sentimental nationalism,
but simultaneously warning their
readers that “realistic nationalism” will
be reactionary and profitless—“what
Scotland wants is not a Parliament of its
own, but more employment, new industries,”
etc., as if the present system were
supplying these, and nationalism threatened
the supply. Happily, as I have
said, the Scottish Home Rule Movement
is rapidly re-orienting itself along realist
lines, but the degree of realism achieved
has not yet reached through to the
financial backwork of our affairs, the real
manipulation area, without control of
which “self-determination” is only a
delusion and a snare. This is not surprising—when
that stage has not even been
reached in the Irish Free State despite
the long history of intense nationalistic
activity there and the relatively great
measure of “political success” achieved.
But the Scottish psychology differs from
the Irish, and, nationalistically laggard as
Scotland has been in comparison with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
other countries, there are grounds for
anticipating that, once it does waken up,
it will redeem the leeway at a single stride
and be the first to penetrate into that
arcanum which still foils even Mr de
Valera with its intangible and ubiquitous
barriers.</p>

<p>Whether “dreamers of dreams” can
still prove themselves “movers and
shakers of the world” or not, the protagonists
of a Scottish Renaissance are
dreaming the dream outlined in these
pages, and have already earned at least
the right to say to their countrymen in
the words of Jaurès: “It is we who are
the true heirs of the ancestral hearth: we
have taken its flame while you have kept
but the cinders.”</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>“A valuable and exceedingly interesting commentary
on a vital phase of modern development.”—<cite>Daily

sensible person to say about the ‘trustification’

<p class="negin1"><b>Rusticus</b>, or the Future of the Countryside.
By <span class="smcap">Martin S. Briggs</span>, <span class="allsmcap">F.R.I.B.A.</span></p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>“Few of the 50 volumes, provocative and
brilliant as most of them have been, capture
our imagination as does this one.”—<cite>Daily
Telegraph.</cite> “The historical part is as brilliant
a piece of packed writing as could be desired.”—<cite>Daily
Herald.</cite> “Serves a national end. The
book is in essence a pamphlet, though it has
the form and charm of a book.”—<cite>Spectator.</cite></p>

<p class="negin1"><b>Janus</b>, or the Conquest of War. By
<span class="smcap">William McDougall</span>, <span class="allsmcap">M.B., F.R.S.</span></p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>“Among all the booklets of this brilliant series,
none, I think is so weighty and impressive as
this. It contains thrice as much matter as
the other volumes and is profoundly serious.”—Dean

deeply interesting and fair-minded study of
the causes of war and the possibilities of their
prevention. Every word is sound.”—<cite>Spectator.</cite></p>

<p class="negin1"><b>Vulcan</b>, or the Future of Labour. By
<span class="smcap">Cecil Chisholm</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>“Of absorbing interest.”—<cite>Daily Herald.</cite> “No
one, perhaps, has ever condensed so many hard
facts into the appearance of agreeable fiction,
nor held the balance so nicely between technicalities
and flights of fancy, as the author of
this excellent book in a brilliant series. <cite>Vulcan</cite>
is a little book, but between its covers knowledge
and vision are pressed down and
brimming over.”—<cite>Spectator.</cite></p>

<p class="negin1"><b>Hymen</b>, or the Future of Marriage. By
<span class="smcap">Norman Haire</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>This candid and unprejudiced survey inquires
why the majority of marriages to-day seem to
be so unsatisfactory, and finds the answer in
the sexual ethic of our civilization which is ill
adapted to our social and economic needs. The
problems of sex-morality, sex-education, prostitution,
in-breeding, birth-control, trial-marriage,
and polygamy are all touched upon.</p>

<p class="negin1"><b>The Next Chapter</b>: the War against
the Moon. By <span class="smcap">André Maurois</span>, author
of ‘Ariel’, etc.</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>This imaginary chapter of world-history
(1951-64) from the pen of one of the most
brilliant living French authors mixes satire
and fancy in just proportions. It tells how
the press of the world is controlled by five
men, how world interest is focussed on an
attack on the moon, how thus the threat of
world-war is averted. But when the moon
retaliates....</p>

<p class="negin1"><b>Galatea</b>, or the Future of Darwinism.
By <span class="smcap">W. Russell Brain</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>This non-technical but closely-reasoned book
is a challenge to the orthodox teaching on
evolution known as Neo-Darwinism. The
author claims that, although Neo-Darwinian
theories can possibly account for the evolution
of forms, they are quite inadequate to explain
the evolution of functions.</p>
</div>

<p class="negin1"><b>Scheherazade</b>, or the Future of the
English Novel. By <span class="smcap">John Carruthers</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>A survey of contemporary fiction in England
and America lends to the conclusion that the
literary and scientific influences of the last
fifty years have combined to make the novel
of to-day predominantly analytic. It has
thus gained in psychological subtlety, but lost
its form. How this may be regained is put
forward in the conclusion.</p>

<p class="negin1"><b>Caledonia</b>, or the Future of the Scots.
By <span class="smcap">G. M. Thomson</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>Exit the Scot! Under this heading the
Scottish people are revealed as a leaderless
mob in whom national pride has been
strangled. They regard, unmoved, the spectacle
of <ins class="corr" id="tn-C17" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'their montrous'">
their monstrous</ins> slum-evil, the decay of
their industries, the devastation of their
countryside. This is the most compact
and mordant indictment of Scottish policy
that has yet been written.</p>

<p class="negin1"><b>Albyn</b>, or Scotland and the Future. By
<span class="smcap">C. M. Grieve</span>, author of ‘Contemporary
Scottish Studies’, etc.</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>A vigorous answer, explicit and implicit, to
<cite>Caledonia</cite>, tracing the movements of a real
Scottish revival, in music, art, literature, and
politics, and coming to the conclusion that
there is a chance even now for the regeneration
of the Scottish people.</p>

<p class="negin1"><b>Lares et Penates</b>, or the Future of the
Home. By <span class="smcap">H. J. Birnstingl</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>All the many forces at work to-day are
influencing the planning, appearance, and
equipment of the home. This is the main
thesis of this stimulating volume, which considers
also the labour-saving movement, the
‘ideal’ house, the influence of women, the
servant problem, and the relegation of aesthetic
considerations to the background.
Disconcerting prognostications follow.</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>Chemistry as the means of human emancipation
is the subject of this book. To-day
chemistry is one of the master factors of our
existence; to-morrow it will dominate every
phase of life, winning for man the goal of all
his endeavour, economic freedom. It may
also effect a startling change in man himself.</p>

<p class="negin1"><b>The Future of Physics.</b> By <span class="smcap">L. L. Whyte</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>The last few years have been a critical period
in the development of physics. We stand on
the eve of a new epoch. Physics, biology, and
psychology are converging towards a scientific
synthesis of unprecedented importance whose
influence on thought and social custom will be
so profound as to mark a stage in human
evolution. This book interprets these events
and should be read in connexion with <cite>Gallio</cite>,

By <span class="smcap">Hubert Griffiths</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquotx">

<p>Taking as text the recent productions of
classical plays in modern dress, the author, a
distinguished dramatic critic, suggests that
this is the proper way of reviving Shakespeare
and other great dramatists of the past, and
that their successful revival in modern dress
may perhaps be taken as an indication of their
value.</p>
